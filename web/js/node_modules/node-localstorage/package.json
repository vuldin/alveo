Maccherone, Jr.\n\n_A drop-in substitute for the browser native localStorage API that runs on node.js._\n\nNote, this does not support the associative array notation supported by the native localStorage.\nHowever, it supports rest of the interface defined in the\n[localStorage spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/#storage) including:\n\n  * length\n  * setItem(key, value)\n  * getItem(key)\n  * removeItem(key)\n  * key(n)\n  * clear()\n\n## Credits ##\n\nAuthor: [Larry Maccherone](http://maccherone.com) (<Larry@Maccherone.com>)\n\n## Usage ##\n\n### CoffeeScript ###\n\n    unless localStorage?\n      {LocalStorage} = require('../')  # require('node-localstorage') for you\n      localStorage = new LocalStorage('./scratch')\n\n    localStorage.setItem('myFirstKey', 'myFirstValue')\n    console.log(localStorage.getItem('myFirstKey'))\n    # myFirstValue\n    \n    localStorage._deleteLocation()  # cleans up ./scratch created during doctest\n\n### JavaScript ###\n\n```JavaScript    \nif (typeof localStorage === \"undefined\" || localStorage === null) {\n  var LocalStorage = require('node-localstorage').LocalStorage;\n  localStorage = new LocalStorage('./scratch');\n}\n\nlocalStorage.setItem('myFirstKey', 'myFirstValue');\nconsole.log(localStorage.getItem('myFirstKey'));\n```\n\n## Installation ##\n\n`npm install node-localstorage`\n\n## Changelog ##\n\n* 0.1.0 - 2012-10-29 - Original version\n\n## MIT License ##\n\nCopyright (c) 2011, 2012, Lawrence S.
