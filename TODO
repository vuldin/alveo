- add imdb object to vids
  - COMPLETE make use of omdbFindVid server function
  - create browser callback function that can be used to populate metadata for a vid object
- server-based localStorage
  - http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html
  - COMPLETE check existing data before making calls to external APIs
  - update the server's top variable, then have a separate thread which periodically checks to see if an update needs to be made to localStorage
    - this would allow for multiple updates to be combined into a single localStorage update
- metadata completion score for vids
  - return a percentage representing the completion of metadata
- COMPLETE periodically update timePlayed of vid
- layout
  - COMPLETE directory listing in banner across top of page from left to right
    - subdirs show on parent click (previously shown subdirs are removed)
  - video list section
    - toggle between list and table views
    - choosing a vid brings up a vid detail div which contains the player
    - sides of the vid detail div show arrows which allow quick navigation to previous/next vid in the list
- COMPLETE recent vids
  - default page will show toplevel directories along with the most recently watched vids in a recent div
  - recent div is hidden from view when vidlist gets populated
  - recent div is shown if no directories are selected (and no videos are shown)
- COMPLETE cCreateDirectoryList getting called when any client makes server request
  - https://github.com/Flotype/now/wiki/Documentation
  - look into using the now namespace (vs everyone) for most server calls
  - sGetList needs to be modified
- find dir object in tree by name
  - this will allow to redraw vidsDiv with appropriate vids based on previous dirdiv selection
- add recently viewed vids to recent collection
  - COMPLETE retrieve this info on page load before any directory is selected
  - revert to recent list when user goes to toplevel by removing all subdirs from view
- leave review for little coffee shop in New Bend
- vidSearch returns incorrect video after adding new directory to video directory
- move all touch/click/mouse/keyboard event handling to a separate function or file
- look into nodejs h.264 streaming module: http://h264.code-shop.com/trac/wiki/Mod-H264-Streaming-Node-Version2
	- this may be the way to have one node server running
- look into vertx
	- 
- during video playback, users create metadata related to current location in video
  - this metadata:
    could be comments, map locations, URL links, translations, video bubble comments at specific locations
    is shown at appropriate times via popcorn.js on subsequent video playback
    can be toggled on/off, rated +/-, filtered on user or ratings
  - the video's location where metadata is associated is selected when user first clicks to add comment
    - this location could be found by reading vid.timePlayed at time of click (which will always be a little earlier in the vid than when actually clicked)
    - frequency of vid.timePlayed updates could be changed accordingly
    
- mozilla webapp:
	- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Manifest
	- app will likely need to be a certified app to run as a background service (need to verify)
	
- offline functionality: localstorage and appcache
	- appcache is for files and folders
	- localstorage is for text and json
	- what are size limitations for each?

- scenario:
	- installation of server; can be initiated in one of the following ways:
		- go to a marketplace and choose install (or download for later install if the app must be a certified package)
		- go to the demo site and the client will be able to detect if anything is installed and if the client system is capable of running the server
